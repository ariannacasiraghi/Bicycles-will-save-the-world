            <p>Inspired by Swedish activist <a class="special" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg">Greta Thunberg</a> and mass movement <a class="special" href="https://rebellion.earth/">Extinction Rebellion</a>, we want to add our voices to a growing chorus: we must take action now to keep our planet habitable. As a reminder that transport alternatives to our most common choices exist, we will cycle over 5000 km in a route that will draw a massive bicycle across 7 countries of western Europe.</p>

            <p> With this, we aim to encourage individuals to cycle as much as possible and prompt governments to invest in suitable and safe infrastructure - following the Dutch model. We do sincerely believe that bicycles can take us a long way in our battle to tackle climate change and environmental breakdown!</p>

              <h2>Some trip details</h2>
              <p>We plan to leave from Orta San Giulio, in northern Italy, at the beginning of July and to reach the crank of the bicycle, in the French village of Vy-l√®s-Lure, within a week or so. From there we will start tracing the bicycle route, minimising the number of sections that must be covered twice (in purple). We will end our undertaking at the top of the bicycle seat tube in Compogne, Belgium. Afterwards we will continue cycling towards Spain, then on to Morocco or wherever the mood takes us!</p>

              <p>It will be the three of us - <a class="special" href="about-us.html">Arianna, Daniel and Zola the dog</a>. While Zola and Daniel will travel on a <a class="special" href="trip-preparations/building-the-cargo-bike.html">custom-built cargo bike</a>, Arianna will cycle on a more standard custom-made tourer. Both these bikes are being built by Daniel, who has recently left academia for a more fulfilling frame-building career.</p>
